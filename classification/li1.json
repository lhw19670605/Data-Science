    "title": "Logistic Regression",
    "summary": "Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary and multiclass classification tasks in machine learning. It is a type of regression analysis that models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. The output of logistic regression is transformed using the logistic function, which maps the predicted values into a range between 0 and 1, representing the probability of belonging to a particular class.\nLogistic Regression is a simple and interpretable algorithm that is widely used in various fields, including medicine, finance, and social sciences. It can handle both categorical and numerical input features and is particularly useful for problems where the relationship between predictors and the response variable is not linear.",
    "advantages": "Interpretability: Logistic Regression provides clear and interpretable results, making it easy to understand the impact of each predictor on the outcome.\nEfficiency: It is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets with ease.\nWorks well with small datasets: Logistic Regression can perform well with relatively small amounts of data, making it a suitable choice for many real-world applications.\nNatural probability output: The logistic function provides probability estimates, allowing you to make decisions based on probability thresholds.\nRobust to noise: It is robust to noise and can handle outliers gracefully.\nFeature selection: Logistic Regression can help identify the most important features for classification.",
    "disadvantages": "Assumption of linearity: Logistic Regression assumes that the relationship between predictors and the log-odds of the outcome is linear. If this assumption is violated, the model's performance may suffer.\nLimited expressiveness: It may not capture complex, nonlinear relationships in the data as effectively as more advanced algorithms like decision trees or neural networks.\nHigh bias or underfitting: Logistic Regression may underfit the data if the true relationship between predictors and the outcome is highly nonlinear.\nNot suitable for multiclass problems: While binary logistic regression is common, extending it to multiclass problems requires additional techniques like one-vs-all or softmax regression.\nSensitive to outliers: Extreme outliers can influence the parameter estimates and predictions in logistic regression.\nIndependence of observations: Logistic Regression assumes that observations are independent of each other, which may not hold true for some datasets.",
