    "title": "Forward Chaining",
    "summary": "In the context of Artificial Intelligence, a forward or forward chaining inference mechanism in expert systems refers to a reasoning approach where the system starts with the available information (facts or data) and progresses through a series of logical inferences and rules to arrive at a conclusion or solution.<br><br>Here's an explanation of forward chaining:<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Fact-Driven Reasoning:</span> Forward chaining operates by beginning with the given facts or data present in the system's knowledge base.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Rule Application:</span> It then applies relevant rules or logic to the existing facts to generate new conclusions or additional information.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Incremental Building:</span> This process continues incrementally, using derived conclusions or new facts as inputs to further derive more information or reach ultimate solutions.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Goal-Oriented:</span> The system proceeds in a goal-oriented manner, utilizing available data to trigger rules and generate new conclusions until the desired objective or conclusion is achieved.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Example:</span> For instance, in a medical expert system, if the symptom \"fever\" is presented, the system may deduce various potential illnesses based on rules in its knowledge base. If further symptoms are provided or deduced, the system continues to draw conclusions, narrowing down possible diagnoses or treatments until it arrives at a final solution or recommendation.<br><br>Forward chaining, or forward reasoning, enables expert systems to utilize available information to derive further conclusions or recommendations. It's commonly used in diagnostic systems, decision-making processes, and problem-solving scenarios where the system's actions are driven by the available data to reach a solution."
