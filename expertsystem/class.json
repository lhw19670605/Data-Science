    "summary": "In the realm of artificial intelligence, expert systems can be classified into various types based on their approach, functionality, and underlying structures:<br><br><h3>Functional Classifications:</h3><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Rule-Based Systems:</span> Utilize sets of rules or \"if-then\" statements to make decisions based on input data, encapsulating expert knowledge in rule formats.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Fuzzy Logic Systems:</span> Handle uncertain or vague information by allowing degrees of truth rather than strict true/false values, enabling nuanced decision-making.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Neural Network-Based Systems:</span> Simulate human brain functionality, learning from data, recognizing patterns, and making predictions through interconnected nodes.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Genetic Algorithm-Based Systems:</span> Employ evolutionary algorithms inspired by natural selection to optimize solutions for complex problems.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Bayesian Networks:</span> Model probabilistic relationships among variables and infer connections while dealing with uncertainty.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Case-Based Reasoning Systems:</span> Solve new problems by recalling and adapting solutions from similar past cases.<br><br><h3>Structural Classifications:</h3><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Framework-Based Expert Systems:</span> Built on structured architectures providing tools and methodologies for developing and executing expert systems.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Model-Based Expert Systems:</span> Utilize specific models to represent domain-specific knowledge and reasoning strategies for problem-solving.<br><br>These classifications provide insights into the functional methodologies used for decision-making and the structural aspects concerning the system's architecture and development methodologies within the domain of expert systems in artificial intelligence."
