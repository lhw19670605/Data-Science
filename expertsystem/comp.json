    "summary": "In the domain of artificial intelligence, expert systems comprise several key components that enable their functioning and decision-making capabilities:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Knowledge Base:</span> This repository stores domain-specific information, rules, facts, and expertise used by the expert system to make decisions and solve problems.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Inference Engine:</span> This component is responsible for reasoning and drawing conclusions based on the knowledge base and provided rules.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">User Interface:</span> The interface allows users to interact with the expert system, input queries, and receive outputs or recommendations.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Knowledge Acquisition System:</span> It aids in the process of gathering, organizing, and inputting knowledge into the system, allowing experts to contribute their knowledge to the knowledge base.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Explanation Facility:</span> This component explains the system's reasoning process and the rationale behind the conclusions or recommendations it provides.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Uncertainty Handling Mechanism:</span> Many expert systems include methods to handle uncertain or incomplete information by using techniques such as fuzzy logic or probabilistic reasoning.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Validation and Verification Module:</span> This ensures that the system's outputs are accurate and reliable by validating the reasoning process and verifying the obtained solutions.<br><br>These components collectively work together to process information, emulate human expertise, and provide solutions or recommendations within specific domains. They enable the expert system to function effectively and make informed decisions based on the provided knowledge and rules."
