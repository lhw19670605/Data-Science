    "title": "Backward Chaining",
    "summary": "In the realm of Artificial Intelligence, backward or backward chaining refers to an inference strategy used in expert systems to reach a conclusion by working backward from a goal or an outcome.<br><br>Here's an explanation of backward chaining:<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Goal-Oriented:</span> Backward chaining starts with a specific goal or desired outcome and works backward to determine what facts or rules are necessary to reach that goal.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Rule Application:</span> It then identifies and applies rules or logical inferences from the system's knowledge base that can lead to the desired goal.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Incremental Approach:</span> It proceeds step-by-step, using the goal to trigger sub-goals or conditions that need to be met, working back through the chain of rules until it reaches a point where the system can verify the available facts or data.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Example:</span> In a diagnostic expert system, if the goal is to identify a disease, backward chaining begins with the goal (the disease to be identified) and tries to determine the symptoms or conditions that would lead to that diagnosis. It navigates through the knowledge base's rules, working backward until it finds the initial symptoms that are present.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Verification of Preconditions:</span> The system keeps checking for evidence that supports these preconditions, further backtracking until it finds the root causes or initial facts that can confirm the ultimate goal.<br><br>Backward chaining allows expert systems to reason toward a specific goal, breaking it down into smaller sub-goals or conditions and identifying the necessary facts or rules that lead to the desired conclusion or outcome. It's particularly useful in diagnostic or decision-making processes where the system aims to work towards a specific solution from a set goal."
