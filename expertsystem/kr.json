    "summary": "Knowledge representation takes various forms to capture and organize domain-specific information. Some common knowledge representation forms include:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Semantic Networks:</span> These graph-based structures represent knowledge using nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) to illustrate semantic relationships between entities.It corresponds to <span style=\"color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;\">Semantic Network-based Expert Systems.</span><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Production Rules:</span> They utilize a condition-action format, triggering actions when specific conditions are met, aiding in decision-making and inference within the system.They correspond to <span style=\"color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;\">Rule-based Expert Systems.</span><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Frames:</span> Frames represent objects using structured attributes, providing a hierarchical description of an object's properties, relations, and behaviors.This corresponds to <span style=\"color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;\">Frame-based Expert Systems.</span><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Logic-based Approaches:</span> These representations use mathematical logic, such as first-order logic or predicate logic, to express and reason about knowledge with precision.They correspond to <span style=\"color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;\">Logic-based Expert Systems.</span><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Ontologies:</span> These formalized representations describe entity relationships and meanings in a domain, facilitating shared understanding across different systems or applications.They correspond to <span style=\"color: darkgreen; font-weight: bold;\">Ontology-based Expert Systems.</span><br><br>Each of these representation forms serves specific purposes and can be chosen based on the nature of the domain, problem-solving requirements, and the desired level of formalization and expressiveness."
