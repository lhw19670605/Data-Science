    "summary": "In the domain of artificial intelligence, the Inference Engine serves as a crucial component within expert systems. It is responsible for the reasoning and decision-making processes by utilizing the knowledge stored in the system's Knowledge Base.<br>The Inference Engine functions as the core mechanism that performs logical deductions, draws conclusions, and infers new information based on the rules and facts stored in the Knowledge Base. It uses various reasoning methods, such as forward chaining, backward chaining, deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, or heuristic reasoning, to process and manipulate the available information to arrive at solutions or recommendations.<br><br>Key functions of the Inference Engine include:<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Matching Rules and Facts:</span> It matches the given input against the rules and facts stored in the Knowledge Base.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Applying Rules:</span> It applies the relevant rules and logical inferences to deduce new information or draw conclusions.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Inference Mechanisms:</span> Utilizes various reasoning strategies to make decisions and solve problems based on the available knowledge.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Providing Solutions:</span> Generates outputs, recommendations, or solutions based on the processed information and conclusions.<br><br>The Inference Engine works in tandem with the Knowledge Base and other components of the expert system to emulate human-like reasoning processes and provide valuable insights or solutions within specific domains of expertise."
