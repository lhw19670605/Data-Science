    "title": "Knowledge Base",
    "summary": "In the realm of artificial intelligence, the Knowledge Base serves as a critical component within expert systems, encompassing domain-specific information, facts, rules, and expertise. It acts as the repository or database where the system stores and organizes the knowledge required for decision-making and problem-solving processes.<br>The Knowledge Base is structured to capture and represent information in a format understandable to the system, allowing it to reason, infer, and draw conclusions. It typically includes:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Facts:</span> Specific and verifiable pieces of information relevant to the domain.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Rules:</span> Set of guidelines or \"if-then\" statements that represent logical relationships, conditions, or actions within the domain.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Procedural Knowledge:</span> Information about how to perform specific tasks or procedures within the domain.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Heuristics:</span> General strategies, principles, or rules of thumb used to guide problem-solving or decision-making processes.<br><br>The Knowledge Base, often created and refined by domain experts or knowledge engineers, forms the foundation for the expert system's intelligence. The Inference Engine, another component of the system, utilizes this knowledge to process queries, reason, and derive solutions based on the stored information and rules within the Knowledge Base."
