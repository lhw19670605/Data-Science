    "title": "Uncertainty Handling Mechanism",
    "summary": "In the realm of artificial intelligence, the Uncertainty Handling Mechanism is a pivotal component within expert systems that addresses and manages uncertain or incomplete information encountered during the decision-making process.<br>This mechanism is designed to handle various forms of uncertainty, such as imprecise data, incomplete information, or ambiguous situations. It employs techniques and methods to manage uncertainty, ensuring the system can make decisions despite imperfect or vague data.<br><br>Key aspects and functions of the Uncertainty Handling Mechanism include:<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Fuzzy Logic:</span> Utilizes fuzzy set theory to manage imprecise or uncertain data by representing information as degrees of truth rather than strict true or false values.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Probabilistic Reasoning:</span> Uses probability theory to model and reason under uncertain conditions, assigning probabilities to different possible outcomes.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Possibility Theory:</span> Considers degrees of possibility, expressing uncertainty by determining the possibility of certain events occurring.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Expert Weights or Confidence Levels:</span> Incorporates expert opinions or confidence levels in the information to manage uncertainty.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Decision-Making under Uncertainty:</span> Employs algorithms or methodologies that enable the system to make decisions despite uncertain or incomplete information.<br><br>The Uncertainty Handling Mechanism allows expert systems to navigate and make decisions in real-world scenarios where information is uncertain or lacks precision, enhancing the system's adaptability and robustness within various problem-solving domains."
