"Title": "Label Encoding", 
"Summary": "Label Encoding is a data preprocessing technique used to convert categorical variables into numerical labels or codes. Each category or level of a categorical variable is assigned a unique integer label, allowing machine learning algorithms that require numerical input to work with categorical data.",
"Advantages": {
"Reduced Dimensionality": " Label Encoding typically results in lower dimensionality compared to One-Hot Encoding, making it more memory-efficient and faster for model training.",
"Preservation of Ordinal Information": " Label Encoding can capture ordinal relationships between categories when such relationships exist, as the labels are assigned based on their order or significance.",
"Simplicity": " It is a straightforward and simple encoding technique that is easy to implement and understand.",
"Interpretability": " The transformed data is interpretable, as it uses numerical labels that maintain the meaning of the original categories."
},
"Disadvantages": {
"Loss of Information": " Label Encoding may introduce ordinal relationships when there are none in the data, potentially leading to incorrect model assumptions.",
"Arbitrary Assignments": " The assignment of numerical labels is arbitrary and depends on the encoding order, which can impact model results.",
"Incompatibility with Some Algorithms": " Label Encoding is not suitable for algorithms that assume numerical variables have meaningful relationships, as it might lead to misleading interpretations.",
"Collinearity": " The use of numerical labels implies a relationship between categories, which may introduce multicollinearity in some models."
