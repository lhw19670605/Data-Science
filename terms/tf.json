    "title": "Transfer Learning",
    "summary": "Transfer learning in machine learning refers to a technique where knowledge acquired during training in one domain or task is used to aid learning in another related domain or task. Instead of training a model from scratch, transfer learning leverages the knowledge gained from one problem domain to improve learning or performance in a different but related domain.<br><br>Key aspects of transfer learning in machine learning:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Knowledge Transfer:</span> It involves transferring knowledge learned from one model or task to another related model or task. This transfer is typically in the form of learned parameters, representations, or concepts.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Pre-trained Models:</span> Often, models pre-trained on large datasets, such as ImageNet for computer vision or GloVe/Word2Vec for natural language processing, are used as a starting point to transfer their learned features to new, smaller datasets or related tasks.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Adaptation:</span> The transferred knowledge is adapted or fine-tuned to suit the new problem or domain. The goal is to speed up training and improve performance by utilizing existing knowledge.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Domains and Tasks:</span> Transfer learning can occur between domains, such as vision, language, or speech, and across tasks, like classification, regression, or clustering.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Benefits:</span> It helps in scenarios where labeled data is limited by reducing the need for extensive new labeled data, speeds up training, and often improves performance compared to starting from scratch.<br><br>Transfer learning has become a significant area of research in machine learning, allowing models to generalize better across domains and tasks while making efficient use of existing knowledge and resources."
