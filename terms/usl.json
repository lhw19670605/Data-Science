    "title": "Unsupervised Learning",
    "summary": "Unsupervised learning is a category of machine learning where the algorithm works with input data that has no corresponding output labels. The primary objective is to uncover patterns, structures, and relationships within the data without guidance or labeled information.<br><br>Key aspects of unsupervised learning:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Unlabeled Data:</span> Unlike supervised learning, the training data in unsupervised learning lacks labeled output. The algorithm explores the data to find inherent patterns.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Learning Process:</span> TThe model identifies hidden structures or features within the data. Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association mining are common tasks in unsupervised learning.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Types of Problems:</span> Unsupervised learning is used for tasks like clustering, which groups similar data points together, and dimensionality reduction, which reduces the number of variables while retaining important information.<br><br>Algorithms used in unsupervised learning include K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and autoencoders. These algorithms are employed in various applications like customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data compression, where labeled data isn't available, and finding patterns is crucial for analysis and decision-making."
