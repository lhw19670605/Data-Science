    "title": "Traditional Machine Learning",
    "summary": "Traditional machine learning refers to a fundamental approach in artificial intelligence where algorithms learn patterns and make predictions based on structured data. Here are the detailed components:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Algorithms:</span> These methods include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and others. Each algorithm has its specific way of learning from data.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Feature Engineering:</span> It involves the manual selection and crafting of relevant features by human experts. These features act as inputs to the machine learning model.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Data Dependency:</span> Traditional machine learning requires structured data with labeled features. The accuracy of the model heavily depends on the quality and relevance of these features.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Model Learning:</span> These models learn from historical data to understand patterns and make predictions on new, unseen data.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Common Applications:</span> Traditional machine learning is widely used in recommendation systems, fraud detection, and classification tasks.<br><br>Challenges with traditional machine learning lie in the reliance on manual feature selection, limitations in handling unstructured data such as images and text, and the interpretability of the models. The emergence of deep learning, with its ability to handle unstructured data effectively, is increasingly complementing and enhancing traditional methods in complex pattern recognition tasks."
