    "title": "Pre-trained Model",
    "summary": "A pre-trained model in machine learning refers to a model that has been previously trained on a large dataset to learn general features, patterns, or representations. This model is then made available for reuse in solving related tasks or for further fine-tuning on a smaller, domain-specific dataset.<br><br>Key points about pre-trained models:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Generalized Learning:</span> Pre-trained models leverage large and diverse datasets to learn general features, allowing them to capture various patterns across different domains.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Transfer Learning:</span> They serve as a starting point for other tasks. Models can be transferred, either as-is or with additional training, to new problems with smaller datasets.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Reduction in Training Time:</span> Pre-trained models can significantly reduce the training time for new tasks, as they have already learned fundamental features and patterns.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Use in Various Applications:</span> They are used in computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and other domains, where they have demonstrated success by learning representations of data that can be transferred to new tasks.<br><br>The versatility of pre-trained models allows for faster deployment of machine learning solutions, particularly in scenarios where limited labeled data is available for specific applications."
