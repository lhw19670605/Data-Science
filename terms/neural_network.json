    "summary": "A Neural Network in the realm of machine learning is a computational model inspired by the structure and functionality of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes, known as neurons, organized into layers. The network processes information by transmitting data through these layers of interconnected nodes.<br><br>Key points about Neural Networks:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Structure:</span> The network comprises layers, typically including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer contains numerous neurons, which are basic computational units.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Learning and Training:</span> Neural Networks learn by adjusting the weights of connections between neurons during a training phase. This process, known as backpropagation, involves adjusting these connection weights based on the error between the predicted output and the actual target.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Activation Functions:</span> Neurons use activation functions to introduce non-linearity, which allows the network to model complex relationships within the data.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Applications:</span> Neural Networks are used in a variety of tasks, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and pattern recognition, due to their ability to learn complex patterns and features.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Deep Learning:</span> Deep Neural Networks, comprising many hidden layers, form the foundation of deep learning, allowing for more sophisticated feature extraction and representation.<br><br>Neural Networks have gained prominence for their ability to handle complex and high-dimensional data, performing various tasks and providing state-of-the-art solutions across multiple domains in the field of machine learning."
