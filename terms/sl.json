    "title": "Supervised Learning",
    "summary": "Supervised learning is a foundational technique in machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. In this learning paradigm, the algorithm is provided with input data along with the corresponding correct output or target. The model learns to map the input data to the output by generalizing patterns and relationships from the labeled examples.<br><br>Key features of supervised learning:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Labeled Data:</span> The training dataset is composed of input-output pairs, where the output is known or labeled.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Training Process:</span> The model iteratively learns from the labeled examples by adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual labeled outputs.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Types of Problems:</span> Supervised learning addresses two types of problems: classification, where the output is categorical, and regression, where the output is continuous.<br><br>Supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, and more sophisticated models like random forests and gradient boosting machines. These algorithms can be applied to various domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and medical diagnosis, among others, where labeled data is available for training."
