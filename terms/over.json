    "title": "Overfitting",
    "summary": "Overfitting refers to a scenario in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, to the extent that it starts to capture the noise and irrelevant patterns present in the data. This can result in the model's decreased performance when presented with new, unseen data, leading to poorer generalization.<br><br>Characteristics and causes of overfitting:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">High Complexity:</span> A model that is too complex might have too many parameters, allowing it to fit the training data perfectly but perform poorly on new data.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Insufficient Data:</span> With insufficient data, a model may mistakenly learn patterns that are not generalizable but rather specific to the training set.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Highly Sensitive to Noise:</span> Noisy data can mislead the model into learning patterns that donâ€™t actually exist in the broader population.<br><br>To address overfitting, various techniques are employed, such as cross-validation, regularization, early stopping, and feature selection, among others. These methods aim to improve a model's ability to generalize and perform well on unseen data."
