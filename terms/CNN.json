    "summary": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks primarily designed for processing and analyzing visual data. CNNs are particularly effective in tasks related to computer vision, such as image and video recognition, classification, object detection, and segmentation.<br><br>The key characteristics and components of CNNs include:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Convolutional Layers:</span> These layers apply convolution operations to input images, using filters or kernels to extract features. These filters slide over the input images, creating feature maps that highlight patterns and shapes.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Pooling Layers:</span> These layers downsample the feature maps obtained from convolution, reducing the spatial dimensions of the data while retaining essential information. Common pooling methods include max pooling and average pooling.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Activation Functions:</span> Non-linear activation functions, like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), introduce non-linearity to the network, enabling it to learn complex relationships between the input and output data.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Fully Connected Layers:</span> These layers are typically found towards the end of CNNs and perform classification or regression tasks based on the learned features extracted by earlier layers.<br><br>CNNs leverage parameter sharing and feature hierarchies to learn and identify patterns at various levels of abstraction, making them highly effective for image recognition tasks. They have become a fundamental architecture in deep learning and are widely used in numerous applications, including image classification, object detection, facial recognition, and medical image analysis."
