    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions through interaction with an environment. The agent performs actions and receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, guiding its learning process.<br><br>Key aspects of Reinforcement Learning:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Trial and Error Learning:</span> The agent learns by taking actions in an environment and observing the rewards received for those actions.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Objective-Oriented Learning:</span> The goal is to discover the most effective sequence of actions to maximize cumulative rewards.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Exploration and Exploitation:</span> The agent balances exploring new actions to understand the environment better and exploiting known actions to maximize its reward.<br><br>Reinforcement Learning is applied in various domains, including robotics, game theory, finance, and control systems, where autonomous decision-making is crucial. Popular algorithms in reinforcement learning include Q-learning, SARSA, and deep reinforcement learning methods like Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Policy Gradient methods."
