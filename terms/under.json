    "title": "Underfitting",
    "summary": "Underfitting occurs in machine learning when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It fails to learn the training data well and performs poorly on both the training set and new, unseen data.<br><br>Key characteristics and causes of underfitting:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Insufficient Model Complexity:</span> The model might lack the capacity to capture the complexity of the data and, as a result, cannot learn the underlying patterns effectively.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Too Much Regularization or Simplification:</span> Overly simplified models due to excessive regularization or feature selection may limit the model's learning capability.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Limited Training Data:</span> Inadequate data for training the model can result in underfitting as the model fails to learn the necessary patterns.<br><br>Addressing underfitting often involves increasing the model's complexity by adding more parameters, reducing regularization, selecting appropriate features, or acquiring more data to provide a broader representation of the problem. These approaches help the model learn the underlying patterns in the data more effectively."
