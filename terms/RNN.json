    "summary": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks designed to effectively process sequential data, such as time-series, text, and speech. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs possess a feedback loop, allowing them to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior and handle data with temporal dependencies.<br><br>Key characteristics of RNNs include:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Temporal Processing:</span> RNNs can remember and leverage information from previous inputs due to their internal memory, making them suitable for sequential data where the order is critical.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Recurrent Connections:</span> These networks have connections between neurons in the hidden layers, allowing them to maintain state information across different time steps.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Vanishing and Exploding Gradient Problems:</span> RNNs can face challenges with vanishing or exploding gradients during training due to their recurrent nature, impacting long-term dependency learning.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Types of RNN Cells:</span> Variations include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells, which offer improved memory capabilities and are better at handling vanishing gradient problems.<br><br>RNNs have found applications in natural language processing, machine translation, speech recognition, and other tasks that involve sequential data analysis, enabling them to capture contextual information and dependencies among elements in a sequence. Despite their effectiveness, RNNs have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem."
