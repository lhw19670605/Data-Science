    "summary": "A Decision Tree in the domain of machine learning is a predictive modeling approach that utilizes a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their potential consequences. It comprises a structure where internal nodes represent features, branches symbolize decisions, and leaf nodes denote outcomes or results.<br><br>Key points about Decision Trees:<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Tree Structure:</span> The structure mimics a tree, where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, each branch denotes a decision, and each leaf node indicates the final outcome or decision.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Learning and Decision-Making:</span> The tree learns from data by making decisions based on the values of features, with each decision leading to further nodes until a final outcome is reached.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Splitting Criteria:</span> Decision Trees use various criteria, like Gini impurity or information gain, to determine the most effective ways to split the data into subsets, optimizing the tree's predictive capability.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Interpretability:</span> Decision Trees are easy to understand and interpret, making them valuable in explaining and visualizing decision-making processes.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Applications:</span> Decision Trees are used in various fields for tasks such as classification and regression. They are efficient for understanding the relationships between various variables and their impact on outcomes.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Ensemble Methods:</span> They are often used as building blocks for more complex algorithms like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, forming part of ensemble methods to enhance predictive accuracy.<br><br>Decision Trees serve as a foundation for more advanced algorithms and offer valuable insights into decision-making processes, making them a widely used and interpretable tool in machine learning."
