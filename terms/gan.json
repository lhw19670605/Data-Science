    "summary": "GAN stands for Generative Adversarial Network, a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs are composed of two neural networks that compete against each other in a game, hence the term \"adversarial.\" These two networks are the Generator and the Discriminator.<br><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Generator:</span> This network generates new data instances that resemble the training data. Its goal is to produce fake data that is indistinguishable from real data in the eyes of the Discriminator.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Discriminator:</span> This network evaluates data instances to determine whether they are real (from the dataset) or fake (created by the Generator). Its goal is to accurately classify the generated data as fake.<br><br>The training process involves the Generator trying to produce increasingly convincing fake data, while the Discriminator strives to become better at distinguishing fake data from real data. This process is analogous to a forger trying to create a fake painting and an art detective trying to detect the forgery. Over time, the Generator learns to produce highly realistic data, and the Discriminator improves its ability to detect fakes. This adversarial process leads to the generation of high-quality, realistic data.<br><br>GANs have a wide range of applications including, but not limited to, image generation, photo realistic image synthesis, style transfer, image super-resolution, and more. They have been pivotal in advancing the field of synthetic data generation, contributing to significant improvements in realism and variety."
