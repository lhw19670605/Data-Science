    "summary": "<h3>What is generative AI in simple terms?</h3>Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that broadly describes machine learning systems capable of generating text, images, code or other types of content, often in response to a prompt entered by a user.<br>Generative AI models are increasingly being incorporated into online tools and chatbots that allow users to type questions or instructions into an input field, upon which the AI model will generate a human-like response.<br><br><h3>How does generative AI work?</h3><br>Generative AI models use a complex computing process known as deep learning to analyze common patterns and arrangements in large sets of data and then use this information to create new, convincing outputs. The models do this by incorporating machine learning techniques known as neural networks, which are loosely inspired by the way the human brain processes and interprets information and then learns from it over time.<br>To give an example, by feeding a generative AI model vast amounts of fiction writing, over time the model would be capable of identifying and reproducing the elements of a story, such as plot structure, characters, themes, narrative devices and so on.<br>Generative AI models become more sophisticated with the more data they receive and generate — again thanks to the underlying deep learning and neural network techniques. As a result, the more content a generative AI model generates, the more convincing and human-like its outputs become.<br><br><h3>Examples of generative AI</h3><br>The popularity of generative AI has exploded in 2023, largely thanks to the likes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E programs. In addition, rapid advancement in AI technologies such as natural language processing has made generative AI accessible to consumers and content creators at scale.<br>Big tech companies have been quick to jump on the bandwagon, with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others all lining up their own generative AI tools in the space of a few short months.<br>There are a variety of generative AI tools out there, though text and image generation models are arguably the most well-known. Generative AI models typically rely on a user feeding it a prompt that guides it towards producing a desired output, be it text, an image, a video or a piece of music, though this isn’t always the case.<br><br><h3>Examples of generative AI models include:</h3><br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">ChatGPT:</span> An AI language model developed by OpenAI that can answer questions and generate human-like responses from text prompts.<br<span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">DALL-E 3:</span> Another AI model by OpenAI that can create images and artwork from text prompts.<br><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-weight: bold;\">Google Bard:</span> Google’s generative AI chatbot and rival to ChatGPT.

Its first model, the irreverent Grok, came out in November.<br><br><h3>Types of generative AI models</h3><br>There are various types of generative AI models, each designed for specific challenges and tasks. These can broadly be categorized into the following types.<br><br><h3>Transformer-based models</h3><br>Transformer-based models are trained on large sets of data to understand the relationships between sequential information, such as words and sentences. Underpinned by deep learning, these AI models tend to be adept at NLP and understanding the structure and context of language, making them well suited for text-generation tasks. ChatGPT-3 and Google Bard are examples of transformer-based generative AI models.<br><br><h3>Generative adversarial networks</h3><br>GANs are made up of two neural networks known as a generator and a discriminator, which essentially work against each other to create authentic-looking data. As the name implies, the generator’s role is to generate convincing output such as an image based on a prompt, while the discriminator works to evaluate the authenticity of said image. Over time, each component gets better at their respective roles, resulting in more convincing outputs. Both DALL-E and Midjourney are examples of GAN-based generative AI models.<br><br><h3>Variational autoencoders</h3><br>VAEs leverage two networks to interpret and generate data — in this case, it’s an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the input data and compresses it into a simplified format. The decoder then takes this compressed information and reconstructs it into something new that resembles the original data, but isn’t entirely the same.<br>One example might be teaching a computer program to generate human faces using photos as training data. Over time, the program learns how to simplify the photos of people’s faces into a few important characteristics — such as size and shape of the eyes, nose, mouth, ears and so on — and then use these to create new faces.<br><br><h3>Multimodal models</h3><br>Multimodal models can understand and process multiple types of data simultaneously, such as text, images and audio, allowing them to create more sophisticated outputs. An example might be an AI model capable of generating an image based on a text prompt, as well as a text description of an image prompt. DALL-E 2 and OpenAI’s GPT-4 are examples of multimodal models."
